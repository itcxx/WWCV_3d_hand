Hand pose estimation has extensive applications in fields such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing models based on single-view image input face numerous challenges in terms of accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance, particularly when dealing with 3D pose tracking issues caused by hand occlusion in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative method that utilizes a dual-camera system mounted on the hand to capture images from different perspectives, enabling 3D hand pose estimation. To generate accurate 3D hand pose labels, we designed a system comprising four depth cameras that capture the hand from multiple angles, thereby creating a new dataset that includes synchronized dual-camera images and precise 3D hand pose labels. Our dataset is the first to support 3D hand prediction using dual-view inputs.

Our approach processes the dual-camera images using xxxxxxxxx technology to predict the 3D pose of the hand, effectively overcoming the limitations and occlusion issues of traditional third-person single-camera methods. Our 3D detection model shows great potential for application in high-demand fields such as robotic hand control. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, providing an efficient and reliable solution for real-time hand pose estimation, with the potential to drive further development in related applications.

## Background
The paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
